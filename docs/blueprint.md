- Background color: Light, desaturated purple (#F2E9F8) to maintain a clean and professional look.
- Accent color: Vibrant, analogous magenta (#D81B60) to draw attention to key actions and important data displays in the interface.
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headings, and 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text. Poppins offers a touch of modernity suitable for display headlines, while PT Sans is readable for long blocks of text.
- Ensure the betting interface is intuitive and easy to use, focusing on clear information hierarchy and visual cues.
- Use smooth transitions and updates for the real-time graph, providing a visually engaging and seamless user experience.
