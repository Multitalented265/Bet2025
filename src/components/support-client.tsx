        question: "How do I place a bet?",
        answer: "To place a bet, go to the Home page, find the candidate you want to bet on, enter the amount you wish to wager in the input field, and click the 'Place Bet' button. Your bet must be a multiple of 100 MWK."
    },
    {
        question: "How are winnings calculated?",
        answer: "We use a pari-mutuel system. All bets go into a single prize pool. If your candidate wins, the total pool is divided among all winning bettors, proportional to how much they bet. You can find a detailed example on the Home page."
    },
    {
        question: "How do I deposit or withdraw money?",
        answer: "Navigate to the 'Wallet' page. From there, you can choose to either 'Deposit' or 'Withdraw' funds. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete your transaction. Please note that a 2.5% fee applies to all transactions."
    },
    {
        question: "What happens if a candidate withdraws?",
        answer: "If a candidate withdraws from the election, all betting on that candidate is closed. In a real-world scenario, policies for handling existing bets on withdrawn candidates would apply, such as refunding the stakes. For this prototype, the bets remain but will be settled as 'Lost'."
